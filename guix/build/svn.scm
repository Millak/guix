;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This is the build-side support code of (guix svn-download).  It allows a
;;; Subversion repository to be cloned and checked out at a specific revision.
;;;
;;; Code:

(define* (svn-fetch url revision directory
                    #:key (svn-command "svn")
                    (recursive? #t)
                    (user-name #f)
                    (password #f))
  "Fetch REVISION from URL into DIRECTORY.  REVISION must be an integer, and a
valid Subversion revision.  Return #t on success, #f otherwise."
  (apply invoke svn-command
         "export" "--non-interactive"
         ;; Trust the server certificate.  This is OK as we
         ;; verify the checksum later.  This can be removed when
         ;; ca-certificates package is added.
