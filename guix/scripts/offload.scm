;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; Attempt to offload builds to the machines listed in
;;; /etc/guix/machines.scm, transferring missing dependencies over SSH, and
;;; retrieving the build output(s) over SSH upon success.
;;;
;;; This command should not be used directly; instead, it is called on-demand
;;; by the daemon, unless it was started with '--no-offload' or a client
;;; inhibited build hooks.
