;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This module implements the "effectful" parts of system
;;; reconfiguration. Although building a system derivation is a pure
;;; operation, a number of impure operations must be carried out for the
;;; system configuration to be realized -- chiefly, creation of generation
;;; symlinks and invocation of activation scripts.
