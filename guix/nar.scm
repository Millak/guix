;;; Restoring a file set into the store.

;; "build hooks", which cannot invoke the daemon's 'import-paths' RPC since
;; (1) the locks on the files to be restored as already held, and (2) the
;; $NIX_HELD_LOCKS hackish environment variable cannot be set.
;;
;; So we're really duplicating that functionality of the daemon (well, until
;; most of the daemon is in Scheme :-)).  But note that we do use a couple of
;; RPCs for functionality not available otherwise, like 'valid-path?'.
