  "Run the COMPUTE procedure of all <installer-step> records in STEPS
sequencially. If the &installer-step-abort condition is raised, fallback to a
previous install-step, accordingly to the specified REWIND-STRATEGY.

REWIND-STRATEGY possible values are 'previous, 'menu and 'start.  If 'previous
is selected, the execution will resume at the previous installer-step. If
'menu is selected, the MENU-PROC procedure will be called. Its return value
has to be an installer-step ID to jump to. The ID has to be the one of a
previously executed step. It is impossible to jump forward. Finally if 'start
is selected, the execution will resume at the first installer-step.

The result of every COMPUTE procedures is stored in an association list, under
the form:

		'((STEP-ID . COMPUTE-RESULT) ...)

where STEP-ID is the ID field of the installer-step and COMPUTE-RESULT the
result of the associated COMPUTE procedure. This result association list is
passed as argument of every COMPUTE procedure. It is finally returned when the
computation is over.

If the &installer-step-break condition is raised, stop the computation and
return the accumalated result so far."
