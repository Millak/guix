;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This module provides procedures for talking with the connman daemon.
;;; The best approach would have been using connman dbus interface.
;;; However, as Guile dbus bindings are not available yet, the console client
;;; "connmanctl" is used to talk with the daemon.

;;; Technology record.

;; The <technology> record encapsulates the "Technology" object of connman.
;; Technology type will be typically "ethernet", "wifi" or "bluetooth".

;; The <service> record encapsulates the "Service" object of connman.

;; if applicable. Finally, state is "idle", "failure", "association",
;; "configuration", "ready", "disconnect" or "online".
