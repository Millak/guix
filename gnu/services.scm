;;; Comment:
;;;
;;; This module defines a broad notion of "service types" and "services."
;;;
;;; A service type describe how its instances extend instances of other
;;; service types.  For instance, some services extend the instance of
;;; ACCOUNT-SERVICE-TYPE by providing it with accounts and groups to create;
;;; others extend SHEPHERD-ROOT-SERVICE-TYPE by passing it instances of
;;; <shepherd-service>.
;;;
;;; When applicable, the service type defines how it can itself be extended,
;;; by providing one procedure to compose extensions, and one procedure to
;;; extend itself.
;;;
;;; A notable service type is SYSTEM-SERVICE-TYPE, which has a single
;;; instance, which is the root of the service DAG.  Its value is the
;;; derivation that produces the 'system' directory as returned by
;;; 'operating-system-derivation'.
;;;
;;; The 'fold-services' procedure can be passed a list of procedures, which it
;;; "folds" by propagating extensions down the graph; it returns the root
;;; service after the applying all its extensions.
;;;
;;; Code:
