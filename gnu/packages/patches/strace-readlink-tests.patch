Prevent strace's "readlink" and "readlinkat" tests from failing due to the
additional system call made by glibc with the patch "glibc-dl-cache.patch"
applied (introduced in commit 52564e9).

These changes cause strace to report during these tests only system calls on
files contained in the test directory, effectively filtering out the
additional readlink/readlinkat call on "/proc/self/exe" and allowing the tests
to complete as normal.
