    (description
     "Hugs 98 is an interpreter and programming environment for developing
Haskell programs.  It provides an almost complete implementation of Haskell
98, which includes expression and pattern syntax, primitives for monadic I/O,
with support for simple interactive programs, handle-based I/O, and exception
handling.  Hugs has a nearly complete implementation of the Haskell module
system and supports a number of advanced extensions.")
