    (description
     "ddcutil can query and modify most external monitors' settings, such as
brightness, colour levels, and input sources.  Generally speaking, any setting
that can be changed by pressing buttons on the monitor can be modified by
ddcutil.

ddcutil communicates directly with monitors implementing the Monitor Control
Command Set (@dfn{MCCS}).  It usually does so through the the Display Data
Channel Command Interface (@dfn{DDC/CI}) protocol on the I2C bus, but can also
communicate over USB as per the USB Monitor Control Class Specification.

One particular use case is in colour profile management.  Monitor calibration
is relative to the monitor colour settings currently in effect, e.g. red gain.
ddcutil allows colour-related settings to be saved at the time a monitor is
calibrated, and restored when the calibration is applied.")
