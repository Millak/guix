@code{sparse_hash_set} and @code{dense_hash_set} are the set versions of these
routines.  All these implementation use a hashtable with internal quadratic
probing.  This method is space-efficient -- there is no pointer overhead --
and time-efficient for good hash functions.")

Any C structure can be stored in a hash table by adding @code{UT_hash_handle}
