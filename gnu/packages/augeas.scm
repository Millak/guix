    (description
     "Augeas is a library and command line tool for programmatically editing
configuration files in a controlled manner.  Augeas exposes a tree of all
configuration settings and a simple local API for manipulating the tree.
Augeas then modifies underlying configuration files according to the changes
that have been made to the tree; it does as little modeling of configurations
as possible, and focuses exclusivley on transforming the tree-oriented syntax
of its public API to the myriad syntaxes of individual configuration files.")
