;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This is a wrapper for the linker.  Its purpose is to inspect the -L and
;;; -l switches passed to the linker, add corresponding -rpath arguments, and
;;; invoke the actual linker with this new set of arguments.
;;;
;;; The alternatives to this hack would be:
;;;
;;;   1. Using $LD_RUN_PATH.  However, that would tend to include more than
;;;      needed in the RPATH; for instance, given a package with `libfoo' as
;;;      an input, all its binaries would have libfoo in their RPATH,
;;;      regardless of whether they actually NEED it.
;;;
;;;   2. Use a GCC "lib" spec string such as `%{L*:-rpath %*}', which adds a
;;;      `-rpath LIBDIR' argument for each occurrence of `-L LIBDIR'.
;;;      However, this doesn't work when $LIBRARY_PATH is used, because the
;;;      additional `-L' switches are not matched by the above rule, because
;;;      the rule only matches explicit user-provided switches.  See
;;;      <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2012-09/msg00110.html> for details.
;;;
;;; As a bonus, this wrapper checks for "impurities"--i.e., references to
;;; libraries outside the store.
