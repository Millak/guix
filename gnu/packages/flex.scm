    (description
     "Flex is a tool for generating scanners.  A scanner, sometimes
called a tokenizer, is a program which recognizes lexical patterns in
text.  The flex program reads user-specified input files, or its standard
input if no file names are given, for a description of a scanner to
generate.  The description is in the form of pairs of regular expressions
and C code, called rules.  Flex generates a C source file named,
\"lex.yy.c\", which defines the function yylex().  The file \"lex.yy.c\"
can be compiled and linked to produce an executable.  When the executable
is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of text matching the
regular expressions for each rule.  Whenever it finds a match, it
executes the corresponding C code.")
