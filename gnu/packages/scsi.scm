    (description
     "sg3-utils is a collection of utilities for devices that use the Small
Computer System Interface (SCSI) command set.  It includes utilities to read
data from, write data to, control, modify, and query the state of SCSI
devices.  For example, this package provides command-line tools to copy data
based on @code{dd} syntax and semantics (called @code{sg_dd}, @code{sgp_dd}
and @code{sgm_dd}), check INQUIRY data and VPD pages (@code{sg_inq}), check
mode and log pages (@code{sginfo}, @code{sg_modes} and @code{sg_logs}), spin
up and down disks (@code{sg_start}), do self tests (@code{sg_senddiag}), parse
sense data (@code{sg_decode_sense}), and perform various other functions.  In
addition, this package includes a library, called libsgutils, which can be
used in C and C++ programs to interact with SCSI devices.")
    ;; The libsgutils library itself is licensed under bsd-3.  Some tools are
    ;; licensed under bsd-3, also.  Some tools are licensed under gpl2+.
